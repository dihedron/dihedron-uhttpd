dihedron-commons
================

This project contains a set of common utilities which can be (re-)used across
Java projects. Some utilities help circumvent problems with the Java6 API, 
some others try to make the use of certain Java features easier, and some 
provide a basic set of more complex functionalities (called "patterns").
